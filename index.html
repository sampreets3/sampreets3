							Hello, my name is Sampreet Sarkar. I recently graduated from Ecole 
							Centrale de Nantes, where I was pursuing my <a href="https://www.ec-nantes.fr">
							Master's in Control and Robotics</a>, specialising in Embedded Real-Time Systems.<br /><br />

							I did my end-of-studies internship in the domain of Embedded Vision and Machine Learning at 3D Aerospace, 
							a young European start-up working in AI-Enabled predictive maintenance for the Viticulture industry. My work was 
							focussed in using Deep Learning and Computer Vision to detect and track individual vines in a vineyard. It was a
							great experience for me since I not only got to learn about how we can use Computer Vision to our advantage in the field, 
							but was also able to integrate the concepts of viticulture that I gained from my colleagues into the solution.<br /><br />

							I am currently working as a research engineer at the <a href="https://www.cea.fr">French Atomic Energy Commission <i>(Commissariat à l'énergie atomique 
							et aux énergies alternatives)</i></a> in Nantes, where I work in the <em>Robotics for the Assistance of Humans</em> team. My current work focusses on the control and path planning for 
							a collaborative robot arm to reach objects in a rapidly changing environment. It's a fun project, which has helped me learn a lot about the real-world 
							applications for robotics. Using ROS2 and MoveIt2 to generate a plan to an object in a scene also gave me a decent bit of exposure towards the overall 
							software development side of things.<br /><br />

							I am interested in a lot of things and curious by nature, so I generally try to take up a wide variety of activities. Not all of them stick with me long-term, it's 
							still a process of trial and error for me. Some things I do like to do in my free time is hang out with my friends <em>(We play darts a lot)</em>, playing the guitar/modifying guitar effects pedals 
							<em>(yes I know, super nerdy stuff)</em>, and if the weather permits, go for a nice walk to de-stress and relax a bit.<br /><br />
